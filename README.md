# Library-management-system

For better management of library resources, record students' borrowing and returning books, and better allocation of resources like library study rooms, we create an easy access and management database system. This database can be used to record the studentsâ€™ details, borrow and return books,  the reservation of study rooms and lecture halls, and so on.
